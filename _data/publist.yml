- title: "Optically Modulated and Optically Activated Delayed Fluorescent Proteins through Dark State Engineering"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: Modulating fluorescent protein emission holds great potential for increasing readout sensitivity for applications in biological imaging and detection. Here, we identify and engineer optically modulated yellow fluorescent proteins (EYFP, originally 10C, but renamed EYFP later, and mVenus) to yield new emitters with distinct modulation profiles and unique, optically gated, delayed fluorescence.

- title: "Synchronously amplified photoacoustic image recovery (SAPhIRe)"
  image: TBG_SL.png
  description: In molecular and cellular photoacoustic imaging with exogenous contrast agents, image contrast is plagued by background resulting from endogenous absorbers in tissue. By using optically modulatable nanoparticles, we develop ultra-sensitive photoacoustic imaging by rejecting endogenous background signals and drastically improving signal contrast through time-delayed pump-probe pulsed laser illumination. Gated by prior pump excitation, modulatable photoacoustic (mPA) signals are recovered from unmodulatable background through simple, real-time image processing to yield background-free photoacoustic signal recovery within tissue mimicking phantoms and from ex-vivo tissues. Inherently multimodal, the fluorescence and mPA sensitivity improvements demonstrate the promise of Synchronously Amplified Photoacoustic Image Recovery (SAPhIRe) for PA imaging in diagnosis and therapy.
